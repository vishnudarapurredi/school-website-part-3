    <p>This year we have also ventured into practicing organic gardening and implementing the techniques 
      for the beautification of the school campus and thus promote the use of eco-friendly products. 
      The Nature Club has installed waste segregation facilities in the school campus. Also a rain water-harvesting 
      unit has been installed in the campus. Numerous street plays and awareness programmes are being 
      enacted at different public places across the city to increase awareness among the common people. Plans are 
      also underway to equipments to make a part of the school building solar powered.</p>

    <p>The goal of the maker club is to empower students to become confident creators and tinkerers 
      who can design and collaborate on projects. Members explore everything from building with 
      cardboard to making a working circuit through student-driven and developmentally appropriate projects. 
      Members use science, technology, engineering, arts, and math as core areas. </p>
